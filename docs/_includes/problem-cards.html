  <p>
    We are designing an assistive mobility device for <strong>Kinematic/Kinesthetic</strong>, a live performance by the
    “physically integrated” <strong>AXIS Dance Company</strong>. The intent is not to “fix” disability by imitating
    non-disabled movement, but to treat engineered locomotion as an expressive medium—exploring unfamiliar,
    “species-atypical,” and/or “superhuman” movement that expands how audiences understand ability and embodiment.
  </p>

  <h3>User</h3>
  <p>
    The primary rider is a <strong>wheelchair user</strong> transported during performance. The user may sit
    <strong>cross-legged</strong> or in a standard seated posture and must retain a clear line of sight.
  </p>

  <h3>What the device must do</h3>
  <p>
    The robot must move a seated rider using <strong>leg-initiated locomotion</strong> (wheels may exist as auxiliary
    load support, but legs must initiate/control motion). It must translate forward/backward, rotate in place (zero-radius
    turning), and be safe, robust, and not excessively loud for live performance.
  </p>

  <h3>Goal</h3>
  <p>
    Build a <strong>leg-controlled</strong> mobility device that can <strong>transport a seated rider to a designated point
    within 6 inches in 1 minute</strong>, while remaining safe, robust, portable, and performance-appropriate.

      <ul>
        <li>10’ straight within ~1 minute</li>

        <li>Additional expressive motions beyond locomotion (e.g., leg extension, “plié/relevé”-like behavior)</li>
        <li>Variable speed capability (suggested 1–4 mph range)</li>
        <li>More complex navigation (mapping/sensor fusion), safer human-aware behavior</li>
        <li>Distinctive, intentional aesthetic / form factor</li>

<!-- Card 4: Why this is hard -->
<div class="t2-card">
  <h2>Why this is hard</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>High payload + low mass + compact footprint:</strong>
      carrying a person while staying stable and under weight/size limits drives actuator sizing, structural stiffness, and stability margins.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Leg locomotion + repeatable navigation:</strong>
      legs introduce slip/compliance and intermittent contact, which complicates estimation and consistent point-to-point performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Safety without restraints:</strong>
      the rider must be safe without being strapped in, pushing conservative acceleration, smooth motion, and highly reliable stopping.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Noise under load:</strong>
      footfalls, impacts, and drivetrain noise must be controlled while moving heavy loads.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Portability + fast setup:</strong>
      the machine must break down cleanly into modules with reliable connectors and repeatable alignment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Robustness + aesthetics:</strong>
      clean wiring, protected electronics, and good-looking fabrication must be built in—not tacked on late.
    </li>
  </ul>
