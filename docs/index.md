## About this project
We’re building a legged, human-carrying mobility robot for Kinematic/Kinesthetic, a live performance by the pioneering “physically integrated” AXIS Dance Company. The machine transports a wheelchair user without wheels as the primary locomotor, using articulated legs to move forward/backward and rotate in place (zero-radius turning), while remaining compact, robust, and safe for performance use (including an emergency stop and low-noise operation). 

This project matters because it treats assistive technology as an expressive medium, not just a medical device. Instead of “fixing” disability by imitating non-disabled movement, the goal is to explore unfamiliar and potentially “superhuman” motion—expanding how we think about ability, embodiment, and performance through engineered movement.
