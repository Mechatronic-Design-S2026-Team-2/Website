  <h2>About this project</h2>
  <p>
    We’re building a legged, human-carrying mobility robot for Kinematic/Kinesthetic, a live performance by the pioneering
    “physically integrated” AXIS Dance Company. The machine transports a wheelchair user without wheels as the primary
    locomotor, using articulated legs to move forward/backward and rotate in place (zero-radius turning), while remaining
    compact, robust, and safe for performance use (including an emergency stop and low-noise operation).
  </p>
  <p>
    This project matters because it treats assistive technology as an expressive medium, not just a medical device.
    Instead of “fixing” disability by imitating non-disabled movement, the goal is to explore unfamiliar and potentially
    “superhuman” motion—expanding how we think about ability, embodiment, and performance through engineered movement.
